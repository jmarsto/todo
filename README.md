I'll be trying to build a to-do app, incorporating:

- input fields
  - autofocus
  - to create new elements

- buttons

- drag and drop
  - with conditionally set start locations

- animated hovers

Goals:

- learn how to incorporate the above,

- learn more about scope, and what it takes to call functions created elsewhere

- achieve functionality, reorganize the cluster, and be more organized with app architecture going forward
